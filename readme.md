Sentiment Analysis Comparison Online Appendix
---

This is the code for the online appendix at [http://www.uvm.edu/storylab/share/papers/reagan2016a/](http://www.uvm.edu/storylab/share/papers/reagan2016a/)
for the paper *Benchmarking sentiment analysis methods for large-scale texts: A case for using continuum-scored words and word shift graphs*, available on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00531).

That server uses git 1.7.1, so need to use this URL for the remote so it can push:
```
git remote add origin https://andyreagan@github.com/andyreagan/sentiment-analysis-comparison-online-appendix.git
```
